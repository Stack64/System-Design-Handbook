# 📐 System Design Tutorial – From Basics to Advanced

System Design is the process of designing the **architecture, components, and interfaces** of a system so that it meets both **functional and non-functional requirements**.  
This repository provides a **complete, structured System Design learning path** — from fundamentals to **advanced distributed system case studies**.

---

## 🚀 Why Learn System Design?

System Design is crucial for building **robust, scalable, and efficient** software systems.

### Key Benefits
- **Scalability & Reliability** – Build systems that grow without failure
- **Efficient Resource Management** – Optimize performance and cost
- **Adaptability** – Design systems that evolve with business needs
- **Architectural Understanding** – Learn monolithic, microservices, event-driven systems
- **Interview Preparation** – Essential for cracking system design interviews
